        <h1>How the World Could End</h1>

        <h2>Scenarios that spell the end of life as we know</h2>
    </header>
    <section class="section">
        <p>Right now, you're probably feeling pretty good. After all, life inthe developed world is comfortable
            —probably more comfortable than it's been for the average human being throughout all of recorded
            history.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img src="img/human_skull.jpg"/>
            <figcaption class="figcaption">Will you be the last person standing if one of these apocalyptic scenarios
                plays out?
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article,
            you'll learn about a few of our favorites.</p>

        <h3>Mayan Doomsday</h3>

        <p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't
            actually predict a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually
            everything else, why should we trust them on this?</p>

        <h3>Robot Takeover</h3>

        <p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a
            disquieting
            thought. We are already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates fears the day his
            Japanese
            robot slave turns him over by the ankles and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"</p>

        <h3>Unexplained Singularity</h3>

        <p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't just end, maybe today, and maybe with
            nothing more exciting than a puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.</p>

        </aside>
        <h3>Runaway Climate Change</h3>

        <p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If it does, we may have to contend with
            vicious storms, widespread food shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.</p>

        <h3>Global Epidemic</h3>

        <p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions differ about the source of the disease, but
            candidates include monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the flu, warriors from
            the future, an alien race, hospitals that use too many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel
            sprouts. Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.</p>
